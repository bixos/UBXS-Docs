With NFT-Bonds, which will be a new technology we have developed to buy BXS Tokens with UBXS Token, investors will irreversibly transform their UBXS into these specially created NFT-Bonds. These NFT-Bonds will not convert to BXS for 6 months to 12 months. It will provide one-to-one for 6 months, one to four for 12 months, and enough BXS to provide a linear amount of return in the intervals in between. Investors can sell these NFT-Bonds or transfer them between wallets. NFT-Bond / BXS conversion will burn these NFT-Bonds. UBXS tokens used for receiving NFT-Bonds will be burned.
