# 5.1 Short Term Vision

Bixos, with its UBXS Token at its core, envisions a future where real estate ownership is transformed through the power of blockchain technology. This vision unfolds in two distinct yet interconnected timeframes:

* Real Estate tokenization: Bixos aims to establish itself as a key player in the nascent field of real estate tokenization. This involves developing a secure and user-friendly platform for tokenizing property deeds and other ownership documents.
* Decentralized Marketplace Launch: The Bixos platform will feature a decentralized marketplace where users can buy, sell, and trade real estate assets with UBXS token. This will offer greater transparency, efficiency, and flexibility compared to traditional real estate transactions.
* Community Building: Fostering a vibrant community around Bixos and UBXS is crucial for long-term success. This involves engaging with potential users, developers, and industry partners to build trust and awareness.
* Strategic Partnerships: Collaborating with established real estate players and technology companies can accelerate Bixos' adoption and expand its reach within the industry.
