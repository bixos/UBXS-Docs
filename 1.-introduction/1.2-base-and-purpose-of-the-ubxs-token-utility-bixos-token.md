# 1.2 Base and Purpose of the UBXS Token (Utility Bixos Token)

Today, blockchain technologies have become more stable and applicable to the physical world. After the introduction of NFTs, blockchain technologies are able to connect with the physical world. As another major development, thanks to the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), the doors of decentralized corporations on the blockchain have now been opened without the need for the approval of a central authority. DAOs are legal and active in America(1) and proprietaries are not spending time with taxes or legal processes with their services. Taking these developments into account, Bixos Incorporation started working on a project that will shape the future.

The UBXS Token (Utility Bixos Token) lets investors have the tokens Bixos will release to market cheaper. Another purpose of UBXS Token is creating awareness for the future projects, introducing Bixos, compositioning audience and raise funds.

The UBXS Token (Utility Bixos Token) will start a whole new system in which investors can convert their deeds and important ownership documents to NFT. The system will not be limited to this, but will also have a marketplace where houses can be bought and sold. While many sectors were seriously damaged in Covid-19, the real estate sector came out stronger.(2)(3)
